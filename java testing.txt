On first test the code did not work because the method startGamePlayerOne() did not exsist which the current code tried to call, after removing it the code worked as expected

On the second test after I had added in 2 players, the code worked as expected.

On the third test after I added the cooperation options and sentance outcomes, all went as expected.
